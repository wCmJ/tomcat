Apache Tomcat is a Java-capable HTTP server, which could execute special Java programs known as "Java Servlet" and "Java Server Pages(JSP)"

Tomcat is an HTTP application runs over TCP/IP.
In other word, the Tomcat server runs on a specific TCP port from a specific IP address.
The default TCP port number for HTTP protocol is 80, which is used for the production HTTP server.
For test HTTP server, you can choose any unused port number between 1024 and 65535.

Tomcat's directory:
bin:contains the binaries; and startup script(startup.bat for Windows and startup.sh for Unixes and Mac OS), shutdown script(shutdown.bat for Windows and shutdown.sh for Unix and Mac OS), and other binaries and scripts.
conf: contains the system-wide configuration files, such as server.xml, web.xml, and context.xml.
webapps:contains the webapps to be deployed, you can also place the WAP(Webapp Archive) file for deployment here.
lib: contains the Tomcat's system-wide JAR ifles, accessible by all webapps. you could also place external JAR file(such as MySQL JDBC Driver) here.
logs: contains Tomcat's log files, you may need to check for error messages here.
work: Tomcat's working directory used by JSP, for JSP-to-Servlet conversion.


step1:
download and unzip tomcat file to one directory
step2:
set JAVA_HOME to your JDK installed directory
step3:
configure tomcat server
    server.xml:   Set the TCP Port Number
        configure TCP port number to any unused number between 1024 and 65535.
        <Connector port="9999" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" />
    web.xml:  Enabling Directory Listing
            enable derectory listing by changing "listings" from "false" to "true" for the "default" servlet.
            this is handy for test system, but not for production system for security reasons.
            <servlet>
                <servlet-name>default</servlet-name>
                <servlet-class>org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet</servlet-class>
                <init-param>
                  <param-name>debug</param-name>
                  <param-value>0</param-value>
                </init-param>
                <init-param>
                  <param-name>listings</param-name>
                  <param-value>true</param-value>  // false to true
                </init-param>
                <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
            </servlet>
    context.xml:  Enabling Automatic Reload
        We shall add the attribute reloadable="true" to the <Context> element to enable automatic reload after code changes. 
        Again, this is handy for test system but not for production, due to the overhead of detecting changes.
        <Context reloadable="true">
           ......
           ......
        </Context>
